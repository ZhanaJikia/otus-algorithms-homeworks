# OTUS Algorithms Homeworks

Repository containing algorithm problem solutions for the OTUS course at different difficulty levels: **Junior**, **Middle**, and **Senior**.

## Project Structure

```

├── hw02_lucky_tickets/
│   ├── junior/       # Junior level solution
│   ├── middle/       # Middle level solution
│   └── senior/       # Senior level solution
└── README.md
```

## Requirements

- .NET SDK 6.0 or higher
- C# compiler

## Usage

Each level has its own project folder with a complete solution. Navigate to the specific level directory and run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Learning Goals

- Implement algorithm solutions efficiently
- Compare different approaches (brute force, optimized, etc.)
- Understand time and space complexity
- Practice problem-solving at different difficulty levels
